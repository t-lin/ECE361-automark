# Example: Binary Output Comparison
This example is for cases where the program outputs a binary file such as an image or video. This assumes the binary must match exactly with a reference file.
  * Use the `test` script to simply print the name of the output binary file.
  * Use the `check-output` to parse the log (containing the name of the file), and diff it against the reference file.
